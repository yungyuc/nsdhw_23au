Polygon clipping are important operations in algorithm design, especially for computer graphics, computer vision, and computational geometry.

Polygon clipping is the process of cutting off parts of a polygon that lie outside a given boundary.
For example, if you have a triangle that extends beyond the edges of a window, polygon clipping is the operation that trims the triangle to fit inside the window.

Problem to Solve
================

For Polygon Clipping problem, there are many algorithms are capable of solving this problem, 
such as **Sutherland–Hodgman algorithm**, **Greiner–Hormann clipping algorithm**, 
**Vatti clipping algorithm**, **Weiler–Atherton clipping algorithm**.

**Sutherland–Hodgman algorithm**, which is one of the most widely used algorithms for polygon clipping. 
However, it has some drawbacks, such as being **inefficient and slow** for large or complex polygons. 
This is because it must process every edge of the polygon against every edge of the boundary. 
Additionally, it can lead to **numerical errors** and **rounding issues** 
from the use of floating-point arithmetic and intersection calculations.

In this work, we focus on improving the Sutherland–Hodgman algorithm, make it more suitable for large or complex polygons, 
and also decrease the numerical errors.
